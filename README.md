[x] The application should have an input form that collects _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.
[]A 'Submit' button should collect form information and:
    [x] store the information in an array (to later calculate monthly costs)
    [x] append the gathered information to the dom
    [x] clear the input fields
    [] calculate monthly costs and append to the DOM
    [] if the total monthly cost > 20000 add a red background to the total monthly cost in the DOM

[x] create a delete button that removes an employee from the dom.  for base mode it doesn't have to remove the employee's salary from the reported total.
